                   <h2>what is aim or hobby in life</h2>
 <p>
     
   <b> In a generic term purpose or goal is an aim. A person in his childhood might want to be a famous astronaut
     or a movie star or a police officer or something like that.
      Aim means to intend, to try, or to aspire. Each aim generally starts with
       a declaration of a setting the goal,
       then breaking it into smaller pieces over a set timeline.
    Thus to achieve it one has to overcome many obstacles and setbacks from time to time.</b>
    </p>
    <div class=" column side">
<h1>anup life</h1>
<p><b>
    There is a popular saying that a man without an aim is like an aim without a rudder. 
    It means a ship without rudder faces danger. Thus similarly a man without aim cannot reach towards his 
    goal of life. He stumbles in his way of life.

So every person must have a definite aim. 
So, the aim of life is to give your life a purpose and a meaning. Certainly,
 it is done by finding out what truly matters to you. Your purpose is to create more joy in life or to show others
  how you can live your life in the best possible manner.</b>
